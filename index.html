                    <h4>
                        Hi, on programming websites I call myself "arger".
                        My real name is Timur and I live in the capital of Russia,
                        Moscow. now (2022) I am only 12 years old and I learn 
                        programming since I was 10 years old, as soon as I got a computer.
                        I study at school number 2007fmsh in the 7th grade. 
                        My school is one of the best schools in Russia, and at 
                        the same time it is physical and mathematical.
                        I also know English, Germany and little bit  French.

                <div class="frame__content">
                    <h4>
                        my first and favorite programming language was C++, by the way 
                        this is also my main language. Now I know a little more, 
                        than the basics of this language and continue to improve.
                        I also know Python, html, css and the basics of Javascript and C#.

                        I'm not going to stop there. 
                        my plans for next year are to fully learn dynamic programming in C++, 
                        make several games in Python and C#, and create a website with 
                        programming tips.
